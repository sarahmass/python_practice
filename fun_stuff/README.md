# Fun Stuff README
- hedgehog.py:
 
   This code is my translation from MatLab to Python.  MathWorks posted code for the hedgehog on their LinkedIn profile here: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/the-mathworks_2_nationalhedgehogday-activity-7159218684543045632-Cia0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop  
   I needed to make some changes to the ranges of some of the arclengths, and I added comments to explain how each of the pieces were developed mathematcially speaking.  And then I let Matplotlib do the rest.  
  Below is the resulting hedgehog.
