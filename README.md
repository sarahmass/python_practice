# python_practice

- Solutions in python to puzzles and assignments that I have solved. To solve the problems I did not use AI or search the internet to find the code already written.  I enjoy solving the problems on my own. I do however look up syntax, libraries, and ways to do something that I am trying to do.  I do not copy the code but take suggestions from others. When I have solve a problem in a trivial way that is not performant I try to then come up with an algorithm that is better.  When I am finished I look at other's solutions and sometime take ideas from them but only after I have solved it myself. 

- While most people play video games, I like to solve puzzles or put them together. It is relaxing and fun for me. I do not like it when people give away the answer so that I no longer have to struggle.  I feel that I learn the most in my struggle.  I am open to feed back and ideas on ways to improve my work. Please drop me a message or a comment and let me know if you see something worth improving.
