# python_practice

- I am including scripts to the different python puzzles and assignments that I have solved.  When I can I will reference the class that the problems were assigned in. In some cases, They were written for online courses that are still live and referencing the cource makes them more searchable.

- In as many cases as possible I have included the design instructions for the problem I was solving in a doc string at the top of the file.
